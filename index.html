    <h1>Robert Huang</h1>
    <p>I'm Robert and I'm from NYC.</p>
    <p>I'm mainly from Queens, but recently moved to Brooklyn for transportation purposes to my high school. I went to Brooklyn Tech, the largest high school in New York.</p>
    <p> My hobbies are playing video games, watching anime/shows, and just hanging out with friends.</p>
    <p>I'm Chinese and love all types of food(mostly asian cuisine though). My favorite food is rice - it's amazing.</p>
